            5S Initiative
          </h1>
          <p class="display-6" style="text-align:left;">
            5S is a workplace orginization method that describes how to organize a workplace for efficiency and effectiveness by  identifying and storing the items used, maintaining the area and items, and sustaining the new order. During the tenure of my previous co-op my manufacturing plant wanted to implement 5S in the workplace and decided to do one production line as a test, then if the CEO approved, would to the rest of the manufacturing plant. I managed the engineering portion of the 5S initiative by creating designs and equipment to help organize the workplace more efficiently. Below showcase my contributions to the 5S initiative that would be used plant-wide.

             My largest contribution to the 5S initiative is this shadow board. The original plan the supervisor had was to use pegboard to hang the tools which is what they originally had. The pegboard didn't look very professional so I offered to find an alternative for it. I contacted a sign making company and sent them my AutoCAD design for the shadow board and asked them to print it on 1/4" sintraboard. I created the stand for the shadow board using 80/20 aluminum extrusions and components which I ordered from McMaster Carr. This was the first shadow board for the 5S initiative, the manufacturing company plans to order 7 more.

            The above drawings are embedded magnetic parts made out of UHMW to hold various tools. I created these designs after noticing the amount of rare earth magnets located in the plant and that the tools were difficult to hold to the board using hooks. The blue block located in the above picture is used to hold metal chisels. Each of these pieces was made in the CNC Mill and then I finished them in the manual mill.

            These are more embedded magnetic tool holders that I designed. The design on the left is to hold a prybar while the design on the right is to hold a precision driver. These designs were to be implemented on the new shadow board that I designed before I finished my co-op.

            I created these designs in order to store the brooms and shovels located on the shop floors. The left design holds a large broom and shovel while the right design is meant to fasten onto the broom tree and hole a smaller angle broom. Both of these drawings were sent to fabricators and were implemented plant-wide.
