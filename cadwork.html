            The drawings below showcase a few of the 50+ creations I made using Inventor over the course of my previous co-op at North Star Windows and Doors. The designs were for parts used in different areas of the plant and I created them for use in projects ranging from 3D layouts to part fabrication. On many of these projects, I worked closely with the machinist to design these parts so I could recieve guidance on the correct threads, tolerances and overall design. Overtime, I required less guidance as I learned how to independently design parts and equipment that were structurally sound and cost effective.

             I designed the new window carts with a lowered main frame to reduce the vertical distance required to move the windows on and off the cart. The carts were made to accompany the conveyors and allow the windows to be rolled off of the conveyors and onto the carts seamlessly. The picture on the left illustrates the design proposal created for the carts. The picture on the right shows a few of the window carts in use. A total of 8 were purchased for the mulling department.

            I designed these conveyor frames to be compatable with the pre-existing pneumantic tilt tables located in the mulling section. The table would tilt down into the notches of the conveyors and allow the windows to be rolled across with minimal effort. The left picture depicts the design for the conveyor frame that was sent off to a fabricator. The right picture portrays one of nine conveyor frames that was ordered, the rollers that fit in the slots were purchased from McMaster Carr.

             I worked closely with the machinist to design a simplified version of the original motor end bell depicted on the left. The motor end bell was wearing and in need of a replacment. A new one was designed to be easily machinable while still maintaining the functionality of the original design. The tolerances and fit for the specific bearing were researched and implemented into the design.

             I created the CAD on the left of the current suction cup used in the glass shop in order to address a marking problem they were experiencing. The new suction cup was to be made out of a different material that was predicted to mark the glass less. The drawing on the left is what was sent off to a custom manufacturing company.

             The above parts are window hardware components. The left part is of a pivot bar, a component that allows the sash of the window to flip in and out of the frame. The right component is a housing unit for a counterbalance, a part that keeps a constant force on the sash allowing it to stay open. I created a CAD of the components for a porduct engineer to showcase them.
