          I am an aspiring mechanical engineer with a passion for design and technology. I enjoy taking ideas from start to finish while getting my hands dirty in the process, which usually involves working in the machine shop to bring my designs to life using the mill and lathe. I have a strong interest in controls and automation, and have been applying my knowledge of circuits and programming to learn Arduino. I plan to use my experience with programming and building Arduino projects as a stepping stone to learn about PLCs and their implementation in manufacturing facilities.

          Back in high school, I was heavily involved in a variety of sports, with a focus on football. I was team captain for both my high school varsity football team and Hamilton rep team. As the captain, I had the responsibility to lead my team through challenging situations while maintaining an unwavering determination for success. I learned that for a team to thrive, every member has to contribute to reach a common goal. It was my job as captain to motivate my teammates to continuously improve and try their best. I learned to communicate effictively with other players and coaches to talk strategy and reflect on past plays, and I developed strong interpersonal skills that are transferrable to the workplace. I try my best to be reliable and hardworking person in every situation.
